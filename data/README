Cell Lines 
-------------------------------------------

D4 
   is a murine embryonic stem cell line in which both alleles of
   REST/NRSF have been flanked by loxP sites. 
   It is also known as FloRES

C18 
    is the result of retroviral transfection of Cre into the FloRES cells, 
    and in consequence is a REST -/- murine ES line.



Researchers
--------------------------------------------

Cell lines and chromatin samples were generated by Dr. Chiara Soldati in 
Prof Noel Buckley's Molecular Neurobiology Group at King's College London.

Samples were prepared for sequencing by Siaw Wei Teng at the Genome Institute
of Singapore and were sequenced on an Illumina GAII.


Notes
---------------------------------------------

According to Siaw Wei, the FloRes (D4) H4ac Input sample didn't work and 
will need to be rerun. 

According to Chiara, the same chromatin was used for both the H4ac and the 
H3K9ac, so it shoud be fine to use the D4 H3k9ac Input sample as input for 
the D4 H4ac ChIP.
